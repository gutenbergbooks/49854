      TO THE RUSKIN CLUB:&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p>
      When your Mr. Bamford wrote me that the Ruskin Club was out hunting
      trouble, and that if I would come over here the bad men of the club would
      "do me up," I confess my first impulse was to excuse myself from the
      proffered hospitality. In the first place, as I have never posed as a
      social champion I had no reputation at stake and I was horribly afraid.
      Secondly, while my reading of Socialist and Anti-Socialist literature is
      the reverse of extensive, I am very sure that nothing can be said for or
      against Socialism which has not already been said many times, and so well
      said that a fair collection of Anti-Socialist literature would make a
      punching-bag solid enough to absorb the force of the most energetic of
      pugilists. Finally, the inutility of such a sally presented itself
      forcibly, since there is, so far as I know, no record of the reformation
      of a Socialist after the habit is once firmly established. But while at
      first these considerations were all against my putting on my armor, in the
      end the instinct of eating and fighting, which is as forceful in the
      modern savage, under the veneer of civilization, as in our unpolished
      progenitors, overcame all considerations of prudence, and here I am to do
      battle according to my ability. I promise to strike no foul blows and not
      to dodge the most portentous of whacks, but to ride straight at you and
      hit as hard as I can.

    <h2>
      CRITIQUE OF SOCIALISM
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HILE it is
      doubtless true that no one can live in the world without in some degree
      modifying his environment, it is also true that the influence of a single
      person is seldom appreciable or his opinion upon social questions of
      sufficient importance to excite curiosity, but I confess that when I
      listen to an address intended to be thoughtful, I enjoy it more or at any
      rate endure it better, if I have some knowledge of the mental attitude of
      the speaker toward his general subject. Thinking that possibly those who
      hear me this evening may have the same feeling, I begin by saying that I
      earnestly favor a just distribution of comfort. I suppose that if I should
      analyze the mental processes leading to that wish, I should find toward
      the bottom a conviction that if each had his due I should be better off.
      The objection to the Socialistic program is that it would prevent a just
      distribution of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years ago in a book of which I was guilty, I wrote the following:
      "There is implied in all Socialistic writing the doctrine that organized
      man can override, and as applied to himself, repeal the fundamental law of
      Nature, that no species can endure except by the production of more
      individuals than can be supported, of whom the weakest must die, with the
      corollary of misery before death. Competitive Society tends to the death
      of the weakest, Socialistic Society would tend to the preservation of the
      weak. There can be no question of the grandeur of this conception. To no
      man is given nobler aspirations than to him who conceives of a just
      distribution of comfort in an existence not idle, but without struggle. It
      would be a Nirvana glorious only in the absence of sorrow, but still
      perhaps a happy ending for our race. It may, after all, be our destiny.
      Nor can any right-minded man forbear his tribute to the good which
      Socialistic agitation has done. No man can tell how much misery it has
      prevented, or how much it will prevent. So, also, while we may regret the
      emotionalism which renders even so keen an intellect as that of Karl Marx
      an unsafe guide, we must, when we read his description of conditions for
      which he sought remedy, confess that he had been less a man had he been
      less emotional. The man whom daily contact with remediable misery will not
      render incompetent to always write logically, I would not wish to know.
      But it is the mission of such men to arouse action and not to finally
      determine its scope. The advocate may not be the judge. My animus is that
      I heartily desire most if not all the ends proposed by abstract Socialism,
      which I understand to be a perfectly just distribution of comfort. If,
      therefore, I am a critic of Socialism, I am a friendly critic, my
      objections to its program resting mainly on a conviction that it would not
      remove, but would intensify, the evils which it is intended to mitigate."
      That is quite sufficient in regard to the personal equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There appear to be, unfortunately, as many sects of Socialists as of
      Christians, and if "Capital" were a more clearly written book I should be
      of the opinion that it would be as much better for Socialists if all other
      books on Socialism were destroyed as it would be for Christians and Jews
      if all books on Theology were destroyed, except the Bible. By Socialism I
      mean what some Socialist writers call "Scientific Socialism."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marxism," it might be called. "Humanism," I think Marx would have
      preferred to call it, and I believe did call it, for he dealt with
      abstract doctrine applicable to men and not to nations, and his propaganda
      was the "International." Incidentally, as we pass on, we may notice in
      this connection the dilemma of American Socialists which they do not seem
      to realize. State Socialism has no logical place in a Socialistic program,
      for it merely substitutes the more deadly competition of nations for that
      of the individual, or even "trust" competition now existing, while
      Humanism, or Marxism, tends to a uniform condition of humanity which the
      American proletariat would fight tooth and nail because they would rightly
      believe that for them it would at present be a leveling down instead of
      leveling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl Marx was, of course, not the inventor of Socialism, nor was he, so
      far as I know, the originator of any of its fundamental doctrines,&mdash;the
      doctrine, for example, that all value is derived from labor was part of
      mediaeval clericism,&mdash;but he first reduced it to coherent form and
      published it as a complete and definite system, and upon the issues,
      substantially as he formulated and left them, must Socialism stand or
      fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must assume the members of the Ruskin Club to be familiar with the
      Marxian fundamental propositions, which I do not state because I shall
      confine my attack to the three derived propositions about which discussion
      mainly centers. We certainly do not want an exercise in serious dialectics
      after dinner, but I will say in passing that I do not think that any of
      his fundamental propositions are true, or that his theory of value has a
      single sound leg to stand on, and as for what he calls "surplus value," I
      doubt whether there be such a thing. At any rate he has not proved it, nor
      can it be proved, without taking into consideration the enormous number of
      industrial failures, as well as the more limited number of industrial
      successes&mdash;and there are no data for that purpose. I may also mention
      as what seems to me a fatal flaw in Socialistic philosophy, its
      concentration upon the conditions of industrial society, without adequate
      conception of a provision for the requirements of agriculture.
      Industrialism and commercialism are doubtless conveniences essential to
      our present civilization; but if every factory and all commerce were
      blotted from the earth the world would go right along, and when the
      necessary millions had perished in the adjustment, those remaining would
      be as happy as ever. Mankind adjusts itself to new environments very
      readily. We here in cities talking wisely on these things are wholly
      unnecessary. The farmer is essential, because without him we should
      starve. Nobody else is essential. We must not get the big-head. Economical
      farming on Socialistic methods is impossible, and any successful system of
      Social betterment must be based on the requirements of economical farming.
      Finally, to conclude this preliminary reconnaissance, the attitude of
      Socialism to religion is wholly unjustifiable. I am profoundly convinced
      that the groveling heathen, who in sincerity bows down to a "bloomin' idol
      made of mud," as Kipling puts it, has in him the propagation of a nobler
      and happier posterity than the most cultured cosmopolitan who is destitute
      of reverence. The church and the synagogue are the only existing
      institutions of modern society which are engaged in the work of upbuilding
      and strengthening that rugged personal character which is the only sure
      foundation of any worthy civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not discuss the fundamental Marxian propositions for two reasons. In
      the first place, it would be laborious beyond measure for me, and dreary
      beyond measure for you. For example, the bottom stone in the foundation of
      the sub-basement of the Marxian edifice is the proposition that the
      equation
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      X commodity A=y commodity B
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      essentially differs from the equation
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      y Commodity B = X Commodity A.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, a discussion whether there is between these two equations a
      difference which it is socially necessary to take account of, is a thing
      to be put into books where it can be skipped, and not imposed in cold
      blood even on intellectual enemies. Personally I do not believe there is,
      for I do not think that social phenomena can be dealt with by the rigorous
      methods of mathematics. One can never be sure that the unknown quantities
      are all accounted for. But whether this or similar propositions are
      essential to the discussion of the theory of surplus value or not, I do
      not describe them because they are of no particular importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socialism is not based upon the Marxian theory of value, but the Marxian
      theory of value was evolved in an endeavor to fix a scientific basis for a
      popular movement already fully under way. Socialism is not based on
      reason, but emotion; not on reflection, but desire; it is not scientific,
      but popular. If every Socialist on earth should concede that the Marxian
      theory of surplus value had been knocked into smithereens, it would have
      no more effect on the progress of Socialism than the gentle zephyr of a
      June day on the hide of a rhinoceros. Socialism must be attacked in the
      derived propositions about which popular discussion centers, and the
      assault must be, not to prove that the doctrines are scientifically
      unsound, but that they tend to the impoverishment and debasement of the
      masses. These propositions are three, and I lay down as my thesis&mdash;for
      I abhor defensive warfare&mdash;that
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Rent is rights
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Interest is rights
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Profits are right,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and that they are all three ethically and economically justified, and are
      in fact essential to the happiness and progress of the race, and more
      especially to those who labor with their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, first, <i>rent</i>: I confess that I have no patience with any one
      who claims, as an inherent right, the exclusive ownership of any part of
      the earth. He might as well claim ownership in a section of air. In this I
      am very certain that I have the hearty concurrence of every member of this
      Club. I am so sure of this, in fact, that I am going to make that
      assumption, in which we all agree, the starting point of a little
      dialogue, in which, after the manner of Plato, I will put Socrates at one
      end of the discussion, and some of his friends, whom we will suppose to be
      Phædo, and Crito, and Simmias, and the rest at the other, and we will let
      Socrates and Phædo carry on the conversation, which might run as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;We are agreed, then, that no man has any right
      inherent in himself to the ownership of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Certainly, we agree to that. Such a thing is absurd,
      for the earth is a gift to the human race, and not to particular men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;I am glad that you think so, and am sure we shall
      continue to agree. And if no one man has any right to exclusive ownership
      of land, neither have any two men, since it is plain that neither could
      convey to himself and another any right which he did not possess, nor
      could two men together by any means get lawful title to what neither was
      entitled to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;You are doubtless right, Socrates. I do not think any
      man could dispute that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And if neither one man nor two men can acquire
      lawful title to land, neither for the same reason could any number, no
      matter how great, acquire lawful title.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That certainly follows from what we have already agreed
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And it makes no difference how small or how great a
      portion of land may be. No man and no number of men can acquire lawful
      ownership of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That is also so plainly true that it seems hardly worth
      while to say it. It certainly makes no difference whether the land be a
      square furlong or a continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;As you say, Phædo, that is very evident. The earth
      belongs to mankind, and all men are by nature sharers in its benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;I trust that you will understand that I agree with you
      in that, and so make an end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;It is perhaps best that we be very sure that we
      agree as we go on, so that if we should at any time disagree, we do not
      need to go far back to find where our difference began. The earth is the
      property of men in common, and each has an undivided share in its
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That is another thing too plain to be disputed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And when men hold property in common, each has as
      much right to all parts of it as another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;To be sure. I do not see why we need waste time in
      mentioning things so plain and so trivial.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And when men own property they may do with it as
      they please, and property which men own jointly they may visit and remain
      upon, the one as much as the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Unquestionably that is so, and we should do better to
      go to sleep in the shade, somewhere, than to spend time in repeating
      things so simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;Be patient, Phædo, and in time we may find somewhat
      wherein we do not so perfectly agree. But whatever property men have the
      right to visit and remain upon they are always free to use in common with
      their fellow owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Certainly. Will you never, O Socrates, have done with
      this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And Chinamen, therefore, have full right to come and
      live in California.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo (and the rest)</i>&mdash;We will all see them in hell first.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I am very certain that every Socialist in California will agree both
      with the premises and the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we might try another course of reasoning by which we may perhaps more
      easily reach the predetermined conclusion, and we will let the same
      parties carry on the dialogue, which is a most delightful way of reasoning
      when, as in the case of Plato and myself, the same person conducts both
      sides of the discussion. It might run in this way:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;We have come, Socrates, to discuss with you, if you
      will permit us, the question of the ownership of land. Crito and Hippias
      and myself and others were considering that subject the other day, and we
      were not able to agree. Hippocrates, whom you know, has lately returned
      from the region of Mount Olympus, and as he was hunting one day on the
      lower slopes of the mountain, he came, haply, upon a beautiful vale,
      fertile and well watered, wherein was no habitation or sign of man. The
      soft breezes blew gently over the rich green plain whereon the red deer
      grazed peacefully and turned not at his approach. And when Hippocrates
      returned from his hunt he found upon inquiry that no man of the region
      knew of that vale or had ever heard thereof. So, as he had marked the
      entrance thereto, he returned thither with the intent to remain there for
      a space. And remaining there through the warm summer he fenced in the vale
      and the deer in it, and built him an house, and remained there a full
      year. But certain concerns of his family at that time constrained
      Hippocrates to return to Athens, and since he can no more live in his vale
      he offered to sell it to Hipparchus for a talent of silver for a place to
      keep summer boarders. And Hipparchus was content; but when they repaired
      to the Demosion to exchange the price for the deed, Hippocrates was unable
      to produce any parchment showing his title to the vale. And when he was
      unable to do that, Hipparchus would not pay down his silver, until he
      could make further inquiry. The next day, we all, meeting at the house of
      Phidias, fell to debating whether Hippocrates owned the land and could
      sell it to Hipparchus. And some said one thing and some another, and in
      the end we agreed that when some of us were next together, we would go to
      the house of Socrates, and if he were content, we would discuss the matter
      with him. And today happening to so meet we have come to you, Socrates,
      and would be glad to hear whether you think Hippocrates owns that vale,
      and may sell it or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;You are very welcome, Phædo, and your friends, and
      as for the matter you name, I shall be glad to talk of it with you and see
      if we can come to some understanding of it. But before we can proceed in
      the discussion, it will be necessary to find some starting point upon
      which we can all agree, because until we agree, at the beginning, upon
      some one thing pertaining to the matter, as certain and not to be doubted,
      discussion is useless, but if we can find such a thing, which none of us
      doubt, we may be able to make something of the matter. I propose,
      therefore, O Phædo, that you propound some one statement which all you who
      have been discussing the matter believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Of a truth, Socrates, we discussed the matter till the
      sun went down, but I do not remember any one thing to which we all agreed
      except that there is such a vale at the foot of Mount Olympus, as
      Hippocrates describes, and that he lived therein for a year. That we
      believe because Hippocrates so told us, and all Athens knows Hippocrates
      for a truthful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;That is something, for all truth is useful; but it
      does not seem to me to be such a truth as will well serve for a foundation
      from which we may penetrate, as one might say, the very bowels of the
      subject. I pray you to propound some other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Truly, Socrates, I cannot, nor can we any of us, for
      upon nothing else pertaining to the matter are we able to agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;If it please you, then, I will propound a saying and
      see if you agree with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;We shall be very glad if you will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;I suggest, then, that we begin by agreeing, if we
      are able to do so, that the gods have given the earth to man for his use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Surely that seems to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;I am glad that you think favorably of it, but that
      is not sufficient if we are to reason upon it, because that upon which we
      found our argument must be what we accept as absolute truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;I think the earth was made for mankind, but if in our
      conversation something should also seem true, and yet contradictory to
      that, I know not what I should think.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;Let us, then, think of something else: The earth is
      at any rate surely for the use of some beings. The mighty Atlas would
      never sustain it upon his broad shoulders if it did nobody good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That, at least, is certain, Socrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And it must be for beings who can make use of it and
      enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That also is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And beings which can use and enjoy the earth must be
      living beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Nobody will deny that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And there are no living things except the gods,
      mankind, the lower animals, and plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;I agree to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And it is plain that the gods did not build the
      earth for themselves, for they do not live upon it, except on Olympus, and
      nowhere does the earth produce ambrosia and nectar, which are the food of
      the gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That is true, for the gods live in the heavens and in
      the nether world, and not upon the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And the plants do not use the earth, or enjoy it,
      although they live upon it, but they are themselves used and enjoyed by
      man and beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Certainly the earth was not made for the plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And surely as between man and the lower animals, the
      earth was intended for man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Certainly, that is what we think, but I do not know
      what the lion and the horse and the ox might say, for they certainly use
      the earth and enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;But man is superior to the lower animals, and the
      superior cannot be subordinate to the inferior.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;I do not know how we can tell which is superior. The
      primordial cell in differentiating out of homogeneity into heterogeneity
      developed different qualities in different beings, and of the organs
      integrated from the heterogeneous elements each has its use and many are
      essential to life. In man the brain is more powerful than in the ox, but
      in the ox the stomach is more powerful than in man, and while both stomach
      and brain are necessary, yet is one with a weak brain and strong stomach
      doubtless happier than one with a weak stomach and strong brain. Is it
      not, then, true that the stomach is nobler than the brain, and if so, then
      the pig and the lion and the goat, which have strong stomachs, nobler than
      man, whose stomach could in nowise digest carrion, or alfalfa, or tin
      cans, and therefore may it not be that the earth was made for the lower
      animals, who can use more of its products than man?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;That is a deep thought, O Phædo, which shows that
      you are well up in your Spencer, although shy in your surgery, for it is
      true that the stomach has been removed from a man who lived happy ever
      after, while neither man nor beast ever lived a minute after his brains
      were knocked out; but is it not true that it is by the function of the
      brain that man makes his powers more effective than those of animals
      stronger than he, so that he is able to bear rule over all the lower
      animals and either exterminate them from the earth or make them to serve
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Yes, that is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And we cannot say that the earth was made for beasts
      which themselves are made to serve the purpose of man, for as plants are
      consumed by beasts, so beasts are consumed by man who acquires for his own
      use and enjoyment whatever power is generated by the organs of all other
      living things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That is true, and I can now see that the earth was not
      made by the gods for themselves, or for plants or beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;Therefore it appears to me that it must have been
      made for man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That is true, and I now agree that the earth was made
      for man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;Then, since we have found a common starting point,
      we may go on with our conversation. We have proved that the earth was made
      for man, because man, by powers inherent in himself, can overcome all
      other living things on the earth and subject them to his uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Yes, we have proved that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And the real source of his kingship is power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That must be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And force is power applied to some object, so that
      power and force may be spoken of as the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And where power lies, there and there only is
      sovereignty, and where power ends sovereignty finds its limit. So that,
      for example, if the lion could subdue man and the other animals, the earth
      would be for the use of the lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That is plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And if a company of men should find an island and go
      and live upon it and be strong enough to subdue the wild animals and keep
      out other men, that island would be for their use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That follows, because sovereignty goes with power
      exercised in force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And so if one man should find a vacant space and
      take possession, it would be his.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And what belongs to man, man may dispose of as he
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;All men agree to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And, therefore, since Hippocrates has found a vacant
      space on the earth and taken possession thereof, and no man disputes his
      possession, it is his and he may sell it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That is certainly true, and I do not doubt that
      Hipparchus will now pay down his talent of silver and take over the vale
      in the Olympian forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And if instead of finding an island the company of
      men had found an entire continent it would be theirs if they were strong
      enough to keep it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Surely that is so, for power is but concentrated
      ability to enjoy, and where most power lies, there lies most ability to
      enjoy, and therefore the highest possible aggregate of human happiness, in
      the attainment of which the will of the gods shall be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And if a company can take part of a continent, but
      not the whole, whatever they are able to take is theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Undoubtedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And what is theirs is not the property of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;By no means.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And if it does not belong to others, others may not
      lawfully use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Surely not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And they who do own it may prevent others from
      entering it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;Surely, for hath not the poet said:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "That they shall take who have the power,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And they may keep who can."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;Therefore it is plain that the United States may
      keep Chinamen out of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;There can be no doubt of it whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;And Chinese may keep Americans out of China.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Phædo</i>&mdash;That is another story. One must never let his logic get
      the better of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so we might play with these great subjects forever, with reasoning as
      leaky as a sieve, but good enough to catch the careless or the untrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most interesting lectures which I ever listened to was one
      before the Economic League of San Francisco on the "Dialectics of
      Socialism." The lecturer was a very acute man, who would not for one
      moment be deceived by the sophistry of my Socrates and Phædo, but who,
      himself, made willing captives of his hearers by similar methods. I was
      unable to hear all his address, but when I reluctantly left, it appeared
      to me that he was expecting to prove that Socialism must be sound
      philosophy because it was contradictory to all human observation,
      experience, judgment and the dictates of sound common sense&mdash;and his
      large audience was plainly enough with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialectics of the schoolmen or their equivalent are useless in Social
      discussion. Social phenomena do not lend themselves to the rigorous
      formulas of mathematics and logic, for the human intellect is unable to
      discern and grasp all the factors of these problems. My travesty of Plato
      was intended to illustrate the difficulty of close reasoning on such
      topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither, on the other hand, are we to blindly follow the impulses of
      emotion which lead us to jump at a conclusion, support it with what reason
      we can, but reach it in any event. Emotion is the source of social power,
      but power unrestrained and undirected is dangerous. Energy created by the
      sight of distress must be controlled by reason or it will not relieve
      distress. And by reason I do not mean social syllogisms, of whose premises
      we are always uncertain, but conclusions half unconsciously formed in the
      mind as the result of human experience operating on human feeling&mdash;the
      practical wisdom which we call common sense. Human conduct, individual and
      aggregate, must be regulated and determined by the consensus of the
      judgment of the wisest made effective through its gradual acceptance as
      the judgment of the majority. Private ownership of land, with its
      accompanying rent, is justified, not by an imaginary inherent right in the
      individual, which has no real existence and so cannot be conveyed, but
      because <i>the interests of society require the stimulus to effort which
      private ownership and private ownership only can give</i>. And here I
      shall leave this point without the further illustration and elaboration
      with which I could torment you longer than you could keep awake. And with
      the other two points I will confine myself to the most condensed forms of
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>INTEREST</i>&mdash;Socialists and Non-Socialists agree that what a man
      makes is his. Socialists and I agree that every man is entitled to his
      just share of the Social dividend. I believe, and in this I suppose that
      Socialists would agree with me, that when a man gets his annual dividend
      he may use it, or keep it for future use. If, while he does not use his
      dividend, or the product of his labor, he permits others to use it to
      their profit, it seems to me that he is entitled to some satisfaction in
      compensation for his sacrifice. I believe it to the interest of society
      that he have it. It is by individual thrift that society accumulates, and
      it is wise to encourage thrift.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I build a mill and, falling sick, cannot use it, it is fair that he who
      does use it shall pay me for my sacrifice in building it. If I forego
      possible satisfactions of any kind, those whom I permit to enjoy them
      should recompense me. And that is interest. Its foundation as a right
      rests not only on those natural sentiments of justice with which the
      normal man everywhere is endowed and behind which we cannot go, but on the
      interest of society to encourage the creation of savings funds to be
      employed for the benefit of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>PROFITS</i>&mdash;Private profit is far less a private right than a
      public necessity. Its absence would involve a waste which society could
      not endure. With individual operations controlled by fallible men enormous
      waste is inevitable. It is essential to society that this waste be
      minimized. No industrial or commercial enterprise can go on without risk.
      <i>Profit is the compensation for risk</i>. One of the things which I
      believe, but which cannot be proved, is that from the dawn of history
      losses to individuals by which society gained have exceeded profits to
      individuals, and the excess of these losses is the social accumulation,
      increased, of course, by residues left after individuals have got what
      they could. Whitney died poor, but mankind has the cotton-gin. Bell died
      rich, but there is a profit to mankind in the telephone. Socialists
      propose to assume risks and absorb profits. I do not believe society could
      afford this. I am profoundly convinced that under the Socialist program
      the inevitable waste would be so enormously increased as to result in
      disaster approaching a social cataclysm. This is an old argument whose
      validity Socialists scout. Nevertheless I believe it sound. The number of
      these whose intellectual and physical strength is sufficient for the
      wisest direction of great enterprises is very small. Some who are
      interested in our great industrial trusts carry heavy insurance on the
      life of Mr. Morgan, lest he die and leave no successor. If the natural
      ability is found its possessor will necessarily lack the knowledge which
      Mr. Morgan has accumulated, and in the light of which he directs his
      operations. It is essential that great operations&mdash;and the business
      of the future will be conducted on a great scale&mdash;be directed by
      great wisdom and power. The possessors of high qualities we now discover
      by the trying-out process. They can be discovered in no other way, and
      great effort can be secured only by the hope of great reward. Until human
      nature changes we can expect nothing different. Socialism implies popular
      selection of industrial leadership. Wherever tried thus far in the world's
      history there has usually been abject failure. The mass can choose leaders
      in emotion but not directors of industry. The selection of experts by the
      non-expert can be wise only by accident. If the selection is not popular,
      then Socialism is tyranny, as its enemies charge. If it be popular, or in
      so far as it is popular, direction is likely to fall to the great
      persuaders and not to the great directors. Never did a "people's party"
      yet escape the control of the unscrupulous. <i>No political movements
      result in so much political and social rascality as so-called popular
      movements originated by earnest and honest men</i>. I see no reason to
      suppose that the Socialistic direction of industrial affairs in any city
      would be directed from any other source than the back rooms of the saloons
      where political movements are now shaped. If the Socialistic program were
      to go into effect tomorrow morning there would be here tonight neither
      lecturer nor audience. The good dinner would remain untasted in the ovens.
      Every mortal soul of us would be scooting from one social magnate to
      another to assure that we were on the slate for the soft jobs and that
      nobody was crowding us off. I have no faith in human nature except as it
      is constantly strengthened and purified by struggle. That struggle is an
      irrepressible conflict existing in all nature, and from which man cannot
      escape. It is better for mankind that it go on openly and in more or less
      accord with known rules of warfare than in the secret conspiring chambers
      of the class which in the end controls popular movement. All serious
      conflict involves evil, but it is also strengthening to the race. I wish
      misery could be banished from the world, but I fear that it cannot be so
      banished. I have little confidence in human ability to so thoroughly
      comprehend the structure and functions of the social body as to correctly
      foretell the steps in its evolution, or prescribe constitutional remedies
      which will banish social disease. If I were a social reformer&mdash;and
      were I with my present knowledge still an ingenuous youth in the fulness
      of strength with my life before me I do not know that I would not be a
      social reformer&mdash;I would profess myself a social agnostic, and
      prosecute my mission by the methods of the opportunist. I would endeavor
      to direct the social ax to the most obvious and obtrusive roots of the
      social evil, and having removed them and watched the result, would then
      determine what to do next. Possibly I would endeavor to begin with the
      abolition of wills and collateral inheritance, and so limiting direct
      inheritance that no man able to work should escape its necessity by reason
      of the labor of his forefathers. I might say that I recognized the vested
      rights of the Astors to the soil on Manhattan Island, but that I
      recognized no right as vested in beings yet unborn. I might say that it
      was sufficient stimulation and reward for the most eminent social endeavor
      to select, within reason, the objects of public utility to which resulting
      accumulations should be applied and to superintend during one's lifetime
      their application to those purposes. I might think in this way, and might
      not, were I an enthusiastic social reformer in the heyday of youth, but it
      appears to me now that at any rate we shall make most progress toward
      ultimate universal happiness if we recognize that out of the increasing
      strenuousness of our conflict there is coming constantly increasing
      comfort and better division thereof, and if we direct that portion of our
      energies which we devote to the service of mankind toward such changes in
      the direction of the social impulse as can be made without impairing the
      force of the evolutionary movement, rather than to those which involve the
      reversal of the direction of the force with the resulting danger of
      explosion and collapse. collapse.
